The Croquet platform

The creation of Croquet in 2001 was based on the fundamental need for a more effective and direct communication between developers and more generally
Various groups that sought to cooperate in real -time, in addition to the restrictions that the tools of the season, namely the messages and electronic restrictions,
post office. Alan Kay and his associates believed that classic workplace transfer was restrictive and wanted to create a more flexible and
Dynamic environment that would allow users to work uninterruptedly and regardless of their location to make creation more productive
Interactive software and not only. So, deprived of Douglas Engelbart's view of deep cooperative systems, direct handling of graphics
Items introduced by Ivan Sutherland and taking advantage of Smalltalk's capacity, Kay and his team created the software platform
Croquet open source, a comprehensive development platform.

Croquet supports the collaboration between a group of users by providing access to a 3D graphics environment that users can create and
then use to tune in to him as a group either to go to any other graphic environment they want within the network, through portals,
making the environment of Croquet a shared virtual world and even fully modified. Croquet uses an architecture called Teatime,
which provides the basis for synchronizing objects in Peer-to-peer collaboration activities. The fact that Croquet has been written with Squeak as a base,
It provides in the application the advantages of objective programming to handle objects. The platform also uses some of the
Opportunities inspired by Smalltalk and in particular how to transmit messages. Croquet's messaging system is asynchronous and uses
a post-registration model for communication. Each object of Croquet has its own tail of events and receives messages as they arrive. When a message
It is sent to an object, added to the event tail of the object and processed by the object when ready. This allows
An extremely flexible communication system, which is a fundamental feature of both Smalltalk and Objective Programming in general.
Croquet allows users to process the source code of the three -dimensional world through the world itself and to see the result immediately,
While the world is still working without even the current program to terminate.
Croquet is a wonderful example of the possibilities offered by objectivity if used in the way Croquet has adopted,
that of Smalltalk. While the emphasis on other objective tongues is given to the state of objects, Smalltalk focuses on how they communicate
the objects between them. So we see that Alan's dynamic view has been the basis of both Smalltalk and Croquet. The application of this
Particularity is also evident in the operation of the Croquet where objects communicate with each other by sending messages through the network. In Croquet, each object
It has a unique identity and the messages are sent between objects using their identity. When an object receives a message, it may
either handle the message itself or promote it to another object for processing. This messaging system is the basis for cooperatives
Features of Croquet, such as common -time processing of objects and the ability to interact with objects controlled by
other users. *This style of communication between objects adopted by Smalltalk* is what stands out from the corresponding platforms.

So we conclude that a characteristic of the Croquet that made it extremely original is to support real -time cooperation.
Many users can interact with the same application in real time and even with the changes of a user becoming immediately visible to everyone else.
*A useful application of this particularity is in education*, where, for example, the platform has been used to create virtual classrooms
teaching where students can interact with each other but also with virtual objects.
Although the Croquet platform was extremely innovative and rich in features and capabilities,
She faced critical comments from users who described her as very abstract. At the same time, a disadvantage was considered the fact that it did not provide high security.
There is even the view that one of the main reasons why Croquet did not become as widespread as other platforms is that it was developed
At a time when the technological landscape was changing rapidly and many competitive platforms, but also new languages developed, such as Java that was then done all over
and more popular. As a result, many developers may have been more comfortable with the use of Java and other platforms that used it, which may
contribute to the relatively limited spread of Croquet in space. However, the innovative design and characteristics of Croquet continued to influence the
Developing collaborative, distributed systems and his heritage can be seen in many of the technologies used today.

And while initially, the use of the platform was intended to enhance cooperation between groups, over time expanded to
Educational and military uses, scientific simulations and online games and even today it continues to be tested as a platform
for various purposes. Today, Croquet continues to be released and enriched with modern technologies while it has been described as the functional
Metaverse system. *Alan Kay having initially funded his creation, remains the key adviser and mentor of the team to this day
of Croquet, inspiring the new generation of designers and managers, with the values and principles that pushed him into creating him.*
