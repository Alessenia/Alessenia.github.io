Kristen Nygaard's Biography

Kristen Nygaard, in collaboration with Ole-Johan Dahl, created Simula 67, who is also known as Simula and is considered as the first objectification
Planning language since it was the first to bring characteristics such as class, object as well as concepts such as heredity and subclasses.
These concepts were the basis of not only today's programming languages, but also for Smalltalk. Nygaard was the one who had
The initial ideas for Simula, so in 1960, the creation of the Norwegian Computer Center as a Research Institute and contacted Dahl.
By the end of his life, Kristen Nygaard had dedicated the focus of his research to objectivity.

Initially Simula was intended as a programming language that could simulate complex systems. Kristen and Dahl were interested in simulating
Systems.H this original version of Simula I, would not be popular. So they returned to its processing and this time they wanted to create a language
Programming that could model these systems in a manner not only in programmers but also to other partners who were not necessary
Developers. Based on Algol-60, Simula 67 (known as Simula) was developed between 1962 and 1967. Simula was designed to support creation
Simulations by allowing developers to define objects that represent different elements of the system that are modeling and to identify
At the same time how these objects interact with each other. This approach facilitated the creation of complex simulations and modification
depending on the various needs of the developers.

What made Simula stand out by far from other programming languages that time was beyond objects and classes,
heredity. Kristen Nyygard is the one who first created the concept of inheritance and realized that he himself solved a big problem that along with
Dahl faced during the creation of Simula. At the same time, this concept as we know today is critical as it gives the opportunity
Reusing code block, resulting in unnecessary repetitions of code lines and the end result is more simplified and comprehensive.
Heredity allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes sharing common characteristics and behavior, making the code more organized and
easier to maintain. *This concept has paved the way for designing more flexible systems and is one of the fundamental concepts of objectives
In addition to his valuable contribution to the objective programming, Kristen was a staunch supporter of cooperation, which is evident
And from the team creation of Simula. Therefore, in the context of the tools for making software, Nygaard left one of the most valuable, in our hands,
that of objective. Alan Kay was inspired by the basic ideas that Simula (1967) and Sketchpad (1988) had introduced very early
Alan's pioneering view of the consolidation of objects resulted in the creation of Smalltalk which was the first complete
Objective language, after in addition to heredity, he also supported the rest of the objective, polymorphism and encounter.
Kay was highly appreciated by both Ole-Dahl and Kristen Nyygard. *O Kristen Nygaard and Alan Kay may have had different aspirations in terms of
Objectively programming, however
creativity.*
